# Getting Started



## Spring Native

This project has been configured to let you generate a lightweight container running a native executable. Docker should
be installed and configured on your machine prior to creating the image,
see [the Getting Started section of the reference guide](https://docs.spring.io/spring-native/docs/0.9.2/reference/htmlsingle/#getting-started-buildpacks)
.

To create the image, run the following goal:

```
In the root folder (.../spring-native-lab/):
$ ./gradlew :spring-native-microservice:bootBuildImage

OR

In this subproject folder (.../spring-native-lab/spring-native-microservice/):
$ cd spring-native-microservice
$ gradle bootBuildImage 

```

Then, you can run the app like any other container:
```
$ cd spring-native-microservice
```
```
$ docker-compose up

OR

$ docker run --rm spring-native-microservice:1.0-SNAPSHOT
```
